Credit Where Credit Is Due

This php code and documentation is based HEAVILY off of the awesome work done by mikenmat
and would not have been possible otherwise. (Ok, maybe but with a lot of pain and suffering)

This guy is probably also the reason the PIR events were added to the lightpad output stream
by the developers, which is what I wanted most. Thanks!!
